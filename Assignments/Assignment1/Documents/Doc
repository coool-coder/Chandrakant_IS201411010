1) Basic tools useful for system designs are Modelling and Monitoring.

2) Three phases of system designs are i) Conceptional,  ii) Construction and iii) Operational

3) Write one advantage of  each Analytic Model and Simulation Model.
Ans : Analytic Model - Performance can be
 determined over a
 wide continuous
 range of parameters.
 Time dependent of
 steady state
 models possible
	Simulation Model - Work load and configuration â€” can
 concentrate on parts
 of system which are
 bottle neck

4)  Performance is one of the main concerns of those designing and developing any large programming system.

5) Write three  methodologies for writing large systems?
Ans:
 i) An algorithmic programming language, which is free of most considerations of efficiency.
 ii)A compiler and run time environment which permit the development and check out of a large system
 without reference to its performance 
iii) The process of making a choice of options and specialization for a particular hardware configuration at
 a particular location, commonly called system generation, which might also be the opportunity to bind
 design decisions that relate to performance
